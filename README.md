# How to compile the source code

The game is written in C#, so you need to have the .NET SDK installed.

Use the `dotnet publish` command to compile the source code. Note that MonoGame recommends disabling ReadyToRun and disabling tiered compilation for performance reasons. MonoGame also recommends building the project as a self-contained application so that it requires no external dependencies. We also publish the project as a single binary file simply to reduce the number of output files. Note that although `PublishSingleFile` reduces the number of files, there may still be more than one output file; see https://community.monogame.net/t/building-with-publishsinglefile-on-3-8-1-doesnt-create-a-single-executable-file/18626 for details.

Linux:

    cd "Source code"
    dotnet publish ChessCompStompWithHacks -c Release -r linux-x64 /p:PublishReadyToRun=false /p:TieredCompilation=false /p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained

Windows:

    cd "Source code"
    dotnet publish ChessCompStompWithHacks -c Release -r win-x64 /p:PublishReadyToRun=false /p:TieredCompilation=false /p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained

Lastly, ensure that the `Data` folder is in the same folder as the resulting executable.
